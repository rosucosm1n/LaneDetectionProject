This is a cool project in which i had to create a program that detects the road lanes using the OpenCV library.
This project was coordinated by a Continental Iasi team who provided us with the necessary resources and documentation needed.
The program is developed in Python. At first, I received a 30 seconds raw video of a car driving on a road and a set of instructions, the goal was
to make the program detect the road lanes using a set of image processing filters.

Here is an example of how it works:
P.S. I know it's not perfect. :D
